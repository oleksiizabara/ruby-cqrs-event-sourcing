  "name": "Quidditch",
  "description": "Quidditch is a fictional sport invented by author J. K. Rowling for her fantasy book series Harry Potter. It is a dangerous but popular semi-contact sport played by witches and wizards riding flying broomsticks. Matches are played on a large oval pitch with three ring-shaped goals of different heights on each side, between two opposing teams of seven players each: three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker. Matches are started by the release of magical balls from a set of starting positions; one Quaffle, two Bludgers, and one Golden Snitch. Quidditch is played in the wizarding world of the Harry Potter universe, but has become a globally popular sport, both in the wizarding world and among Muggles (non-magical people).",
